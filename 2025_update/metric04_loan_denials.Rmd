# NOTES: This analysis was originally completed for the February 2024 equity trend using 2018-2022 data (https://www.psrc.org/media/8436). Data saved to 2023 monitoring directories since the data was collected for that project. 

# New data was made available from the FFIEC in July 2025. In future years consider pulling data into R directly using JSON, API. 2024 & 2023 data was cleaned to match table formatting of 2022 - watch this in future years!

# set to eval = FALSE, but when adding a new year, insert new data pull - but only for that year!

# When pulling in new years:

## download the csv
## rename the file in new location
## open file and remove top two rows
## add a column to the left which becomes your new 'A' column and copy the income indicators from previous years into that column
